# RBDAIM
This repository contains the code for training and evaluating the RBD-AIM model, as described in the paper:
"Mining antibody functionality via AI-guided structural landscape profiling"

Model weights and datasets will be made available upon publication. For access before then, you may request it by contacting us at: n.ivanisenko@gmail.com


Example of model inference:

python rbdaim.py

A demo of the model, with a detailed explanation of input and output, is available at:
